# GoAttila
Attila the Hun written in Go Lang to kill the target! More human way to test load for my projects. 

#Not Ready for Non-Programmer

Currently codes have configuration in the proejct. Will be implementing settings later. 

#Settings

* Edit the target
* Set number of soldiers
* Set number of battalion
* Bund and Run "go run main.go"

#Not ab load testing

It doesn't give failed requests or anything. Currently Idea is to observe CPU usage, memory usage by application and lag between master and slave
